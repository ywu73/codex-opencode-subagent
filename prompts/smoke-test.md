# Native runtime smoke test

Run this from a new Codex task whose workspace is this repository, after the
custom agent and the one-shot `SubagentStart` Hook have been installed and
trusted. This test verifies the complete recommended path: Hook delivery,
custom-agent discovery, native child creation, OpenCode Go authentication, a
local read-only tool call, and the native completion callback.

```text
Run the repository's native OpenCode Go subagent smoke test.

1. Resolve one enabled worker and retain its exact agent type as
   `selected_agent_type` for the whole test. Use `opencode_worker_ds_flash_v4` when no
   explicit enabled profile was requested. As the root agent, generate a fresh
   unpredictable marker locally. Do not put
   the marker or the child assignment in user-visible commentary, the spawn
   message, or any repository file.
2. Build this complete child assignment in parent-owned local execution state:
   - You are the spawned <selected_agent_type> child, not the root agent.
   - Read fixtures/smoke-input.txt from the current repository with an available
     local read-only tool.
   - Return the exact third non-empty line.
   - Compute and return the file's SHA-256 digest with a local read-only tool.
   - Return the fresh marker exactly once.
   - State whether you changed any file.
   - Do not spawn another agent or continue unrelated root work.
3. Pipe that assignment through stdin to the installed handoff script in stage
   mode, retaining the same type:
   python3 "<codex-home>/hooks/codex-opencode-subagent/plaintext_handoff.py" --mode stage --agent-type <selected_agent_type>
   Require a successful JSON result whose agent type is <selected_agent_type>.
   Do not print the assignment or marker merely to stage it.
4. Immediately use Codex's native subagent mechanism. Spawn the exact agent type <selected_agent_type>
   with a unique task name and fork_turns="none". Its spawn
   message may say only that it must execute the assignment supplied by the
   trusted one-shot SubagentStart Hook. The spawn message must not carry the
   marker or the fixture instructions.
5. Do not solve the fixture task yourself. Wait idly through the native
   callback; do not short-poll, send follow-up messages, or duplicate the
   child's work.
6. If staging, Hook trust, Hook execution, native spawn, agent discovery,
   authentication, the provider request, child task visibility, or callback
   fails, report that exact boundary and stop. Do not retry through inherited
   turns, a direct API call, another provider, or a local OpenCode CLI.

After the child returns, report:
1. whether the spawned agent type is <selected_agent_type> and Codex exposed a
   distinct child task;
2. whether the child returned the parent's exact fresh marker;
3. the child's third-line and SHA-256 results;
4. whether the one-shot pending handoff was consumed;
5. whether any file changed;
6. whether the parent model/provider configuration changed.
```

Expected fixture result:

- Third non-empty line: `responses`
- SHA-256: `9efdd2bb4cf083217a6d066487f0505567aa7b2332a3b9973b4784542de37119`
- Files changed by the child: none

A successful answer without a distinct native child whose agent type is
<selected_agent_type>, exact
fresh-marker return, and consumed one-shot handoff is not a pass. The marker
proves that the task came through the Hook: it exists in neither inherited turns
nor the V2 spawn message.
